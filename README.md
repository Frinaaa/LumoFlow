ABSTRACT

LumoFlow-AI-program learning and Debugging platform

Programming is an essential skill in computer science education, yet many beginners find it difficult to understand how programs execute internally. Concepts such as variable updates, control flow, function execution, and dynamic web behavior often remain abstract because execution occurs in the background. While students may successfully write code, they frequently struggle to understand how and why the code produces a particular output.

Modern development environments such as Visual Studio Code provide powerful and flexible tools for writing and running programs and are widely adopted in both academic and professional settings. However, beginners often require additional learning support beyond standard code editing and execution, such as visual explanations, step-by-step execution flow, and concept-level guidance.

This project proposes an AI-powered visual code editor and learning platform designed specifically to support beginner-level understanding while retaining familiar development workflows. The system focuses mainly on Python and JavaScript and enhances the learning experience by integrating execution visualization, animated debugging, AI-based explanations, and progress tracking. By presenting side-by-side visual and animated representations of code execution, the platform helps learners connect written code with runtime behavior in an intuitive and interactive manner.
